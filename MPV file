1. Introduction

Project Name: Maze 
Description: A basic maze game where the user navigates through a grid-based maze from a starting point to a goal.
2. Objectives

Provide a simple playable maze game.
Implement basic maze generation and navigation features.
Ensure that the player can start, navigate, and reach the goal.
3. Features

Maze Generation: Create a static or simple randomly generated maze grid.
Player Movement: Allow player to move up, down, left, and right using keyboard inputs.
Goal Detection: Detect when the player reaches the goal position.
User Interface: Basic display of the maze, player, and goal.
4. Technical Requirements

Language: Python (or any preferred language)
Libraries/Tools: Pygame, or any other relevant library for GUI or game development.
5. Implementation Steps

Maze Generation
Create a grid-based maze with walls and open paths.
Implement a simple maze generation algorithm (e.g., random maze, DFS-based generation).
Player Movement
Implement player controls to move through the maze.
Handle boundary conditions to prevent the player from moving through walls.
Goal Detection
Define a goal position in the maze.
Implement logic to detect when the player reaches the goal.
User Interface
Display the maze grid, player, and goal.
Provide visual feedback for player movement and goal achievement.
6. Deliverables

Source Code: The complete source code implementing the MVP features.
Executable File: A runnable version of the game (if applicable).
Documentation: Basic instructions on how to run and play the maze game.
7. Testing

Ensure that the maze generates correctly.
Test player movement and boundary conditions.
Verify goal detection functionality.
Conduct basic usability testing.
8. Future Enhancements

Add more complex maze generation algorithms.
Implement additional features like scoring, timers, or multiple levels.
Enhance the graphical interface and user experience
